### Dataset : Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Transformations
- The training data and test data are megerd in one complete dataset.
- Only the mean and standard deviation values for vairables are extracted from the complete dataset.
- The activity labels are appropriately assigned to each row.
- A tidy dataset is created where each row corresponds to records of averages of a variable for each activity and each subject.
